Unlike traditional AI, which depends on\\nstructured instructions and close oversight, Agentic AI demonstrates adaptability, advanced decision-making\\ncapabilities and self-sufficiency, enabling it to operate dynamically in evolving environments. This survey\\nthoroughly explores the foundational concepts, unique characteristics, and core methodologies driving the\\ndevelopment of Agentic AI. We examine its current and potential applications across various fields, including\\nhealthcare, finance, and adaptive software systems, emphasizing the advantages of deploying agentic systems\\nin real-world scenarios. The paper also addresses the ethical challenges posed by Agentic AI, proposing\\nsolutions for goal alignment, resource constraints, and environmental adaptability. We outline a framework for\\nsafely and effectively integrating Agentic AI into society, highlighting the need for further research on ethical\\nconsiderations to ensure beneficial societal impacts. This survey serves as a comprehensive introduction to\\nAgentic AI, guiding researchers, developers, and policymakers in engaging with its transformative potential\\nresponsibly and creatively.\\nINDEX TERMS Agentic AI, Autonomous systems, Human-AI collaboration, Adaptability, Governance\\nframeworks, Ethical AI.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nA. MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND\\nAgentic AIs constitute a qualitative leap in the development\\nof artificial intelligence, defined by their capability to set\\ncomplex goals in a changing and uncontrolled situation\\nand to pursue them through autonomously managing their\\nresources. Most AI systems, however, were built and operated\\nas tools under supervision with restrictions and definitions\\nprovided. These systems are good at doing well-defined tasks\\nwithin certain boundaries but prominently fail whenever the\\nattempted tasks have no end-state or specific parameters to\\nmanipulate. Whereas Agentic AIs can be low-level operative,\\ni.e., goal-directed, even in situations where there are drastic\\nchanges and multiple such goals to toggle between.\\nOne of the factors that motivated the design of Agentic\\nAIs is the necessity for tools designed to be able to operate\\nin better yet complex real-world conditions with significant\\nroom for flexibility. For example, in disaster relief, healthcare,\\nand cyber security, where proper decisions are needed and\\nthe chaos is considerable, the ability to control a situation\\nindependently is critical. Agentic AIs don’t just assist in\\nhuman action; they enhance it while taking on tasks that\\ndemand high involvement and multi-tasking without constant\\nhuman intervention. Such a paradigm shift promises to expand\\nthe target area of AI from being passive and reactive to\\nfocusing on strategic planning, information processing, and\\nproblem-solving, enabling a new era once the rights conditions\\nare met.\\nThe impact of Agentic AI [1]–[3] on society is likely to be\\nconsiderable. As AI becomes embedded in more and more\\ncore systems and industries, agentic AI systems would be\\nable to work side by side with humans and take on tasks that\\ncan reallocate human effort, increase productivity, and engage\\nin situations where human presence may be undesirable or\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\n1\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

This change could transform job structures in\\nsectors, allowing for working in concert where AIs perform\\noperational tasks and people deal with more complex and\\nstrategic roles.\\nB. DEFINITION AND SCOPE\\nIn this sense, Agentic AI includes the class of autonomous AI\\nsystems [4] that undertake to finish a set of complex tasks that\\nspan over long periods of time without human supervision.\\nIt learns context and makes decisions. Such systems are\\ndesigned to operate with a certain level of autonomy, allowing\\nthem to traverse changing settings, deal with unexpected\\nsituations, and optimize performance over time. Tying them\\ntogether are the features of autonomy and adaptiveness to cope\\nwith task-oriented processes. Unlike classic AI [5], which\\nis rule-based and requires instructions to be performed, and\\ngenerative AI, which patterns and generates an image, Agentic\\nAI features the best of both worlds.\\nIt is valuable to place agentic AI alongside current AI\\nparadigms to put its boundaries into perspective. For example,\\nclassical AI was never focused on image recognition or\\nlanguage translations [6], [7] but instead aimed at achieving\\nvery narrow goals.\\nThe first is how Generative AI [8] works. In reverse\\noperations, it combines pieces of information learned through\\nnumbers and creates content, such as words or images.\\nOn the other hand, Agentic AI surpasses the former two\\napproaches with goal-oriented, input-formed, and adaptable\\ncharacteristics that allow it to accomplish intricate and multi-\\nlayered tasks in a period without needing a set of instructions\\neach time.\\nAt this point of the survey, the focus is on why someone\\nshould be interested in Agentic AI. From its structural and\\noperational characteristics, why is it based on goals, and how\\ncan that advanced type of AI be applied in various fields where\\nits application is unique? In addition, this article also looks\\ninto the various practical and moral issues that arise from\\nusing systems based on such AI and discusses approaches\\nthat deal with safety, transparency, and accountability. The\\nprovided definition of Agentic AI allows the authors of this\\nsurvey to discuss precisely what features of this type of AI\\nsystem distinguish it from others and aid in its effective and\\nintegrated analysis.\\nC. OBJECTIVES AND CONTRIBUTIONS\\nThis survey paper aims to provide an extensive collection\\nof Agentic AI knowledge and set its boundaries for easier\\nunderstanding by a wider audience of researchers, developers,\\nand policy-makers. Key contributions of this survey include:\\n• A systematic review of the main elements that comprise\\nAgentic AI systems with an emphasis on how these\\nsystems differ from other commonsense and generative\\nAI systems.\\n• A comprehensive study of the techniques and concepts\\nused in constructing and assessing Agentic AI, includ-\\ning the architectures, learning approaches, and training\\nmethods.\\n• The current and potential uses in different areas, includ-\\ning practical examples of the effectiveness of Agentic AI\\napplications in practice.\\n• Highlighting engineering problems but not limited to\\nthese: goal design and convergence, context adaptation,\\nand limited resources.\\n• A considers the ethical, societal, and regulatory issues\\nwith adopting Agentic AI, including relevant concerns\\nof responsibility, equity, and transparency.\\n• Recommendations towards future research, advancing\\nsuggestions on how the issues of scale, context, and\\nethics are best integrated into the implementation of\\nAgentic AI.\\nThis paper’s expected contributions are more than simply a\\nliterature review; rather, they should offer a useful and well-\\norganized background to develop the issues and particulars of\\nAgentic AI.

FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS\\nA. AGENTIC AI AND ITS ROLE IN THE AI ECOSYSTEM\\nWithin the AI field, Agentic AI serves as a different form of in-\\ntelligence that can take more autonomously functioning agen-\\ntic behaviors that are not limited to performing specific tasks\\nor following content-generating algorithms. When viewed\\nin an ecosystem context, Agentic AI stands out because of\\nits purpose, flexibility, and behavior, which enables such\\nAIs to operate almost independently. Rather than following\\nstrict guidelines like other robotic AIs, Agentic AI systems\\nare promoted to have rationalism in them, which enables\\neach system [9]to reason and adapt to different scenarios\\nand such circumstances in a sufficient way to accomplish\\ngoals. Due to its tendencies to enhance its functions to prepare\\nfor any obstacles, Agentic AI has been seen as a potential\\npoint of anchor for tasks and goals that require high levels of\\ninteractions, for example, autonomous devices, collaborative\\nrobots, and interactive decision support systems in the areas\\nof finance and health care.\\nThe increasing demand for systems capable of au-\\ntonomously handling intricate and dynamic processes has led\\nto growing interest in Agentic AI, particularly in sectors with a\\nscope for AI automation. Though built on basic AI principles,\\nAgentic AI increases the scope of AI achievement by adding\\nthe elements of dependence and adaptive independent action.\\nThe ecosystem of AI occupies a space between purely reactive\\nand narrowly rule-based AI technologies and broader ideas\\nabout AGI, performing an essential function of enabling\\nautonomous decision-making within defined boundaries or\\nstructures. This unique position accentuates the ability of\\nAgentic AI to fit in scenarios where the ability to make rapid\\ndecisions, manage over-time objectives, and learn on the go\\nare fundamentals to the problem at hand.\\nB. COMPARISON WITH TRADITIONAL AI\\nAI, which can be described as ‘Agentic’ has its core dif-\\nferences when compared to the other advanced types of\\nAIs in terms of autonomy, function, and scope, among\\nothers. Such AI systems are integrated into specific tasks\\nlike image analysis [10], translation of languages [11], and\\nrecommendation engines [12], making them able to perform\\ndesignated tasks in a highly focused but characteristic narrow\\nmanner and scope. They are mostly based on supervised\\nlearning approaches on really big datasets where behavior\\nis determined by the input and instructions given to them by\\npeople. Thus, traditional AIs are best applied in controlled\\nenvironments with limited ability to micromanage situations\\nand rather more significant outcomes.\\nOn the other hand, Agentic AI systems can be described\\nas possessing the characteristic of open-endedness where\\nthere is no prescription of how the task should be achieved.\\nThey work with and adapt to rapidly changing conditions.\\nOn the other hand, while conventional AI systems might be\\naccurate, they do not have the situational awareness and goal-\\ndirected dynamics inherent in Agentic AI. A case example\\nmay include a factory’s AI model that is developed to predict\\nequipment failure. As much as the premise is good, AI will not\\nincorporate adaptive shifts in the way it predicts failures due\\nto factors such as changes in the manufacturing schedule or\\nchanges in wear patterns across machines. On the other hand,\\nAgentic AI could change its metrics estimation processes\\ndepending on the context and adapt both its short and long-\\nterm strategies, which is impossible with traditional models.\\nAs shown in Table 1, Agentic AI systems not only adapt\\nbased on real-time context but also maintain the flexibility\\nto optimize for complex, long-term goals. These distinctions\\nillustrate Agentic AI’s value in scenarios where conventional,\\nrule-bound AI falls short, emphasizing its transformative\\nrole in addressing the demands of unpredictable, high-stakes\\nenvironments.\\nC. EXPANDED COMPARISON WITH CLASSICAL AGENTS\\nWhile classical AI systems are primarily rule-based or\\nsupervised-learning models designed for specific tasks, Agen-\\ntic AI integrates autonomy and adaptability, enabling broader\\nfunctionality. The differences between these paradigms are\\nbest illustrated with examples.\\nClassical Agents: These agents excel in controlled environ-\\nments. For example, rule-based financial trading algorithms\\nfunction effectively when predefined parameters remain con-\\nstant. However, they struggle with volatile market changes or\\nunpredictable disruptions.\\nAgentic AI: In contrast, Agentic AI-powered trading\\nsystems dynamically adjust strategies based on real-time data,\\nhistorical trends, and unexpected market shifts, making them\\nmore resilient and adaptive.\\nReinforcement Learning vs. Language-Model-Based\\nAgents: While reinforcement learning focuses on optimizing\\ncumulative rewards in a specific task environment, language-\\nmodel-based agents extend this by interpreting complex natu-\\nral language inputs and interacting with humans seamlessly.\\nFor example, an RL agent excels at optimizing gameplay\\nstrategies, whereas a language-model-based agent can gener-\\nate dialogue, interpret rules, and adapt strategies during a live\\ngame. Table 2 highlights the key differences.\\nD. TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS\\nThe development of Agentic AI systems relies on core\\nalgorithms and frameworks that enable goal-directed behav-\\nior, contextual adaptation, and autonomous decision-making.\\nThese technical foundations incorporate advances in rein-\\nforcement learning, goal-oriented architectures, and adaptive\\ncontrol mechanisms.\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\n3\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

In RL, agents are trained\\nto maximize cumulative rewards by interacting with an\\nenvironment, adapting their actions to achieve specific goals\\nover time. This learning paradigm is particularly useful for\\nAgentic AI because it enables systems to continuously refine\\ntheir strategies based on feedback. As illustrated in Figure\\n1, reinforcement learning supports \"Learning through inter-\\naction\" and involves a trial-and-error approach to optimize\\ndecisions over time.\\nGoal-Oriented Architectures [14] provide a structural\\nframework for managing complex objectives within Agentic\\nAI systems. Unlike traditional architectures, which often focus\\non single tasks, goal-oriented architectures enable agents\\nto prioritize and pursue multiple objectives simultaneously.\\nThese architectures support a modular structure, where larger\\ngoals are broken into manageable sub-goals. In the context\\nof Figure 1, goal-oriented architectures facilitate \"Managing\\ncomplex objectives,\" allowing agents to approach tasks in\\nstructured steps.\\nAdaptive Control Mechanisms [15] ensure that Agentic\\nAI systems can adjust to changing environments. By incorpo-\\nrating adaptive control, agents recalibrate their parameters\\nin response to external variations, such as data shifts or\\nunexpected disruptions. Techniques like meta-learning, where\\nagents learn to adapt based on prior experiences, enable\\ngreater resilience and flexibility. As shown in the flowchart,\\nadaptive control mechanisms provide \"Environmental adapta-\\ntion,\" allowing agents to maintain optimal performance even\\nunder changing conditions.\\nFigure 1 provides a visual representation of these core\\nframeworks, illustrating how they interact to enable au-\\ntonomous, adaptable, and goal-driven behavior in Agentic AI\\nsystems. Together, these technical foundations equip Agentic\\nAI with the structural and functional capabilities necessary\\nto manage complex, evolving tasks independently, setting it\\napart from traditional AI systems that rely on rigidly defined\\nparameters and instructions.\\nBy combining reinforcement learning, goal-oriented archi-\\ntectures, and adaptive control, Agentic AI systems achieve a\\nlevel of autonomy and resilience that allows them to operate\\neffectively in diverse environments. This section establishes\\nthe technical basis for understanding the advanced capabilities\\nof Agentic AI, providing a foundation for the methodologies\\nand applications discussed in the following sections.\\nIII. CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF AGENTIC AI\\nA. AUTONOMY AND GOAL COMPLEXITY\\nAutonomy is one of the most sought-after qualities that Agen-\\ntic AI can possess. This is especially needed where complex\\nmulti-goal scenarios are involved. Most traditional AI systems\\nfocus on completing one task and are programmed with\\nnon-complicated input and output requirements to achieve\\nthat single goal. In contrast, systems powered by agentic AI\\ncan move through multiple needed tasks and shift from one\\nbasic one to multiple complex end goals. Such systems come\\nwith a certain amount of self-governance where continual\\nsupervision of a human being is not mandatory, though at\\ntimes preferred, and AI agents function independently upon a\\npredetermined or evolving goal structure. One extra step does,\\nhowever, require acknowledgment; for Agentic AI, Autonomy\\nis not just limited to the completion of a single aim–instead,\\nlesser goals, as well as individual strategies, are substituted\\nto meet larger goals that are long-term in nature. An example\\ncan be drawn from autonomous robotics [16], where such an\\nagentic system would demand the complete traversal from\\npoint A to point B, with the additional allowance of making\\ndiversions around the route, moving constraints such as task\\nhierarchy, time frames, energy expendable ratios, and safety\\nstandards. Such an understanding deepens the comprehension\\nof goal complexity, where high-order decision models are\\nused wherein goals guide analysis, planning, and action. Quite\\nclearly, then, as this enables Agentic AI systems to carry\\nout intricate objectives that had been deconstructed into sub-\\ntasks that could fit autonomously into an operational strategy\\n4\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY\\nMoreover, Agentic AI’s capacity to operate within varied and\\nchanging circumstances is yet another characteristic of this\\nAI. Unlike past AI, built for the most optimum functions in\\na constant and easily predictable environment [17], Agentic\\nAIs integrate all the variability in the real world. This involves\\nadjusting quickly to environmental conditions, data or pattern\\nchanges, and even time-worn or newly constituted user\\ndemands. In the case of AI agents for self-driving cars, the\\nideal Agent Did not Photoshop to comply with artificial\\nboundaries contained in traffic laws alone but would learn\\nnew road designs and try to understand how the behavior\\nof other drivers would be before deciding how to act in a\\nparticular situation when the need arises within a very short\\nperiod.\\nTo do this, Agentic AI systems, as a general rule, are\\nequipped with means for environmental interaction, on-the-\\nspot data processing, and situational context comprehension.\\nThese capabilities allow the system to keep track of and\\nactively participate in the operational parameters that are\\nprone to alterations even at the last minute. For instance,\\nchange control [18] in Agentic AI systems is typically\\nembedded within the Agent as reinforcement learning or\\nadaptive algorithms so that the Agent can work optimally\\nregardless of the changing conditions. These characteristic\\nfeatures make Agentic AI fit for use in environments with\\nmany dynamics where reactions must be rapid, such as in\\nDisaster management, healthcare, finance, etc.\\nC. INDEPENDENT DECISION-MAKING AND\\nADAPTABILITY\\nAutonomy and flexibility are core requirements for the\\nAgentic AI to work independently for long hours. In contrast\\nto rule-based systems, which merely do what they are told,\\nAgentic AI has to situate itself in its current context and\\nmake decisions as it is working, so it has to learn over time\\nand improve on its behavior. This type of decision-making\\nis commonly done through reinforcement learning or meta-\\nlearning when the AI agent gets feedback repeatedly and\\nimproves its behavior.\\nFlexibility allows Agentic AI to act differently in the\\nsame scenario and pursue the relevant goals. For instance,\\nin a customer service situation, an agentic AI could change\\nits communication strategies to those that work best with\\ncustomers’ moods to achieve customer satisfaction. This\\nrequires prioritizing goals and assessing possible courses of\\naction and their outcomes with respect to the system’s goals.\\nBecause of flexibility and autonomy in decision-making [19],\\nAgentic AI can reconceptualize its strategies and adapt to new\\ninformation adopted in the model to operate in a changing\\nenvironment.\\nTo further illustrate the integration process of Agentic\\nAI into society, Figure 2 outlines the key stages.

The flowchart visually represents the\\nadaptability and independence of Agentic AI in dynamic\\nenvironments.\\nD. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS\\nCompared to linear systems of regulation, Agentic AI stands\\nout because of its improved ability to remain autonomous,\\nfunction within an ever-changing context, and cope with multi-\\nple goals. In most cases, operative agents are created where the\\nfunctional area is characterized within rigid boundaries, with\\nunfailing and straightforward preconditions for successful\\nperformance. On the other hand, Agentic AI systems are\\ndesigned to work on complex goals that have yet to be\\nstructured and can be defined in a broad context.\\nAs shown in Table 3, traditional agents excel in structured\\ntasks but lack the flexibility required for adaptive, goal-\\noriented tasks in complex environments. Agentic AI advances\\nthese systems by introducing a high degree of autonomy\\nand adaptability, enabling the agent to interact with and\\nrespond to its environment in ways that extend beyond\\nsimple rule-following. This comparative analysis highlights\\nthe distinctive capabilities of Agentic AI, positioning it as a\\ntransformative approach in fields where independent, goal-\\ndriven, and context-aware behavior is essential.\\nIV. METHODOLOGIES IN AGENTIC AI DEVELOPMENT\\nA. ARCHITECTURAL APPROACHES\\nArchitectural approaches in Agentic AI typically involve\\nmodular and hierarchical designs that enable the system to\\nmanage complex goals and adapt to dynamic environments.\\nCommon architectures include multi-agent systems (MAS),\\nhierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), and goal-oriented\\nmodular architectures.\\n• Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): MAS [20] divides tasks\\namong multiple autonomous agents that collaborate or\\ncompete to achieve a common goal. This architecture is\\nparticularly useful in scenarios where complex goals can\\nbe decomposed into smaller tasks that individual agents\\ncan handle.\\n• Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL): HRL\\n[21] structures decision-making hierarchically, where\\nhigh-level agents define sub-goals, and low-level agents\\nexecute them. This approach is effective for managing\\ntasks with multiple levels of complexity.\\n• Goal-Oriented Modular Architectures: These archi-\\ntectures [22] organize agent functions into modular\\ncomponents, where each module specializes in specific\\naspects of the task. Such modularity enables flexibility\\nand scalability, allowing the agent to handle different\\ntasks by reconfiguring modules as needed.\\nB. LEARNING PARADIGMS\\nAgentic AI relies on several learning paradigms, each suited\\nto different types of tasks and goals. The main paradigms\\nused in agentic systems are supervised, unsupervised, and\\nreinforcement learning. Table 4 provides a comparison.\\nC. ADVANCEMENTS IN METHODOLOGIES\\nRecent advancements in Agentic AI methodologies have\\nfocused on key capabilities essential to modern agent design.\\nThese include reasoning and planning, tool use, memory\\nmechanisms, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and\\ninstruction fine-tuning [23].\\nReasoning and Planning: These frameworks enable agents\\nto anticipate outcomes, prioritize tasks, and adapt strategies\\ndynamically. They are critical for managing complex, multi-\\nobjective tasks in evolving environments like disaster manage-\\nment and autonomous navigation.\\nTool Use and Integration: Agents equipped with the\\nability to interact with external tools and APIs can perform\\ncomputations, retrieve real-time data, and simulate scenarios,\\nsignificantly enhancing decision-making processes.\\nMemory Mechanisms: Episodic and semantic memory\\nmodels allow Agentic AI systems to retain contextual infor-\\nmation, improving their ability to recall past interactions and\\noptimize ongoing tasks.\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG empow-\\ners agents to retrieve external knowledge dynamically, enhanc-\\ning the relevance and context of their outputs. This capability\\nis particularly significant in conversational agents and real-\\ntime decision-making systems.\\nInstruction Fine-Tuning: This process ensures that agents\\nunderstand and execute nuanced directives, enabling them to\\nperform multi-step tasks with high precision and adaptability.\\nD. TRAINING AND EVALUATION TECHNIQUES\\nTraining Agentic AI systems requires techniques that allow\\nagents to learn from interactions with complex environments.\\nCommon training techniques include simulation-based train-\\ning, curriculum learning, and multi-task learning.\\n• Simulation-Based Training: Simulations give students\\na safe context to investigate numerous situations without\\nreal-world consequences [24]. This is very effective in\\nreinforcement learning [25] as it allows agents to design\\npolicies that are transferable to the real task.\\n• Curriculum Learning: Structure tasks in increasing\\norder of complexity so that an agent develops basic skills\\nthat can be built upon in new, more complex tasks [26].\\nSuch a structure of progressively more complex tasks is\\nfundamental in a multi-goal-oriented environment.\\n• Multi-Task Learning: In multi-task learning [27],\\nagents acquire the capabilities to perform several tasks\\nat once, which expands their generalization abilities over\\nmultiple goals, tasks, and scenarios. The problem is of\\nutmost interest in designing agentic AI systems that are\\nsupposed to tackle multiple objectives in parallel.\\nEvaluation techniques for Agentic AI often include metrics\\nsuch as task success rate, adaptability, resource efficiency, and\\nlong-term goal achievement.

Table 6 sum-\\nmarizes key methodologies in Agentic AI, their practical appli-\\ncations across domains, and the associated ethical challenges.\\nThis summary provides a concise reference for understanding\\nthe core techniques driving Agentic AI development.\\nV. APPLICATIONS OF AGENTIC AI\\nA. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS\\nAgentic AI can potentially revolutionize multiple industries,\\nincluding healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing.\\nIn healthcare, for example, Agentic AI can be used to analyze\\nincoming patient data, identify abnormal patterns, and alert\\ncorresponding medical personnel to damage. AI-based devices\\ncould, for example, prevent the delay of vital diagnoses\\nby monitoring patients’ key health indicators and notifying\\nthem when the situation worsens. In finance, for instance,\\nAgentic AI algorithms can assist in making investment\\ntransactions, detecting fraudulent activities, and providing\\ntailored investment solutions. They are capable of evaluating\\nthe situation on the exchange, independently making decisions\\nregarding the purchase or sale of securities, and adjusting\\ntheir strategies to changing conditions in real time, which\\nsignificantly improves the quality of managerial performance\\nand reduces the participation of human beings [1].\\nIn education, intelligent tutoring systems utilizing Agentic\\nAI technology assist learners by tailoring educational content\\n[31] to their needs and addressing their progress and requests.\\nSuch an approach leads to enhanced academic performance\\nand decreased pressure on teachers because repetitive tasks\\nsuch as grading and finding appropriate materials are done\\nautomatically. In manufacturing, Agentic AI is applied to\\npredictive maintenance where the state of the machines is as-\\nsessed, future breakdowns are anticipated and maintenance is\\ncarried out when necessary without the involvement of people\\nso that production runs smoothly with minimal delay. It is\\nclear that once implemented, Agentic AI enables industries to\\noperate with greater effectiveness, flexibility, and scalability.\\nB. HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION\\nAgentic AI extends the range of human productivity in\\ncollaborative and cognitive domains [32]. In such knowledge-\\nintensive ventures as legal or research, it can support pro-\\nfessionals by automatically condensing documents, pulling\\nup relevant papers, or performing professional background\\ninvestigations so the users can concentrate on more complex\\naspects of the work. For example, in legal practice [33],\\nAgentic AI can examine a corpus of legal text, remember\\nessential documents and help lawyers retrieve cases with\\nsimilar laws.\\nIn the creative industries, Agentic AI can draft text, develop\\ndesign concepts, or make creative alterations based on earlier\\nedits or client input. Agentic AI tools are expected to be able\\nto reduce such needless tasks and improve the productivity of\\ncontent development. Also, in customer services, Agent AI\\ncan take care of simple questions, offer assistance, and route\\ncomplicated problems to human agents, enhancing response\\ntime and client satisfaction. This seamless integration of\\nhuman-AI collaboration enables workers to spend their time\\nin a more strategic and creative workspace. At the same time,\\nAgentic AI takes care of the operational aspects.\\nC. ADAPTIVE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS\\nThere is a gradual move towards Agentic AI in adaptive\\nor “living” software systems [34], which can change their\\nfeatures without typical limitations and dynamically modify\\ntheir functionalities depending on environmental evolvement.\\nThese variables make the system reconfigure itself rapidly or\\nautomatically to ensure that self-learning improves every time\\naround usage. These include real-time updates of suggestions\\nby people as a function of the recommendations and updates\\nof suggestions based on changes in the evolution of the user\\nrecommendations dynamically.\\nOther cases include automated activities in the smart house\\nwhere, because of the powered agentic AI, boarders can\\nchange the lighting, temperatures and security protocols\\nfor inbuilt AI to note the behavior of the users. In project\\ndevelopment processes, for instance, Agentic AI project\\nmanagement bots can focus on task sequencing, workload\\ndistribution, and task timeline complexity to dynamically\\nalter timelines [35] where necessary, which enables the users\\n8\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

EMERGING APPLICATION AREAS\\nWith dynamic patient needs demanding continuous responsive-\\nness, there are new targeted use cases for applying Agentic AI\\nin specific spheres. Such include personalized medicine [36] ,\\nwhere an Agentic AI system could manage chronic patients\\nby overseeing their patient history, sending medication intake\\nreminders [37], and changing treatment recommendations\\nbased on other health indicators. Such systems would provide\\nindividualistic care-management protocol and even monitor\\nfor early indicators of other progressing health conditions, es-\\npecially for aged people likely to require maximum attention.\\nFor literature creation, Agentic AI is expected to acquire\\nnew roles in generating content automatically, targeting wider\\naudiences and meeting precise parameters in content creation.\\nFor instance, in marketing, Agentic AI systems would send\\ncustomized emails and adverts based on user activity and\\ngenerate content for the adverts in the first place. Furthermore,\\nin the context of self-regulatory research, Scientists using\\nAgentic AI can accomplish the objectives of a literature search,\\ndeveloping new lines of thought, and even creating research\\ndesigns. Faster research periods could be witnessed in the\\nfields of drug development [38] research or climate change\\nresearch. Through expansion in these new directions, Agentic\\nAI shows more ability to penetrate high-value markets requir-\\ning customized, dynamic and self-servicing applications.\\nTable 7 provides an overview of Agentic AI applications\\nacross various domains, illustrating the diverse range of tasks\\nand contexts where autonomous, goal-directed systems can\\nenhance operations and create value.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF AGENTIC AI\\nIMPLEMENTATIONS\\nA. COMPARISON METRICS\\nTo comprehensively assess and triangulate Agentic AI deploy-\\nments, it is necessary to identify metrics commensurate with\\ntheir output, flexibility and leverage. The following metrics\\nare prevailing in the field:\\n• Adaptability: This metric considers the AI system’s\\npropensity or capability to react to environmental mod-\\nifications that are prompt or abrupt actively. A high\\nadaptability [39] score means the AI system can undergo\\nperformance losses due to novel conditions like shifts\\nin statistical measures, but not to the extent of incurring\\nsignificant losses.\\n• Goal Achievement Efficiency: This metric reflects on\\nthe AI’s inclination or ability to achieve its goals while\\nusing minimal resources such as time and person-hours.\\nThis metric becomes critical in applications where the\\nprovision of the AI model’s determinism has strong\\nconsequences on the feasibility of the application.\\n• Learning Rate and Convergence: Measures the time\\nthe AI takes to learn and attach to a specific task. Quick\\nlearning rate and quick convergence are always preferred\\nas they enable the AI to work effectively in dynamic\\nenvironments requiring continual learning [40], [41].\\n• Robustness and Resilience: This measure determines\\nthe system’s performance level when its parameters\\nchange or during disturbances. Robustness [42], [43]is\\none attribute that enables the effective design of Agentic\\nAI, which can operate in several vitiating circumstances,\\nsuch as unexpected scenarios well deepened in the\\nhealthcare and autonomous driving sectors.\\n• Scalability: It refers to the system’s qualities, which\\nmust not change as the range or complexity of tasks\\nchanges. This is an important characteristic in industries\\nwith significant volumes of data or operational processes,\\nsuch as the case with finance or manufacturing [44].\\n10\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

CASE STUDIES\\nThe case studies presented in this subsection illustrate the\\npractical uses and performance of agentic AI systems in\\nseveral scenarios. These examples highlight the capabilities\\nof Agentic AI in accomplishing complex goals in a changing\\nenvironment.\\n• Healthcare Monitoring and Diagnostics: A healthcare\\nmonitoring system based on Agentic AI developed\\nfor healthcare monitoring can independently identify a\\npatient’s state to be deteriorating through steady tracking\\nof patients’ vital signs. This system has been tested in\\na hospital to enhance the timeliness of patient health\\nintervention [47]. It is becoming critical as it improves\\nthe time taken to respond to various health issues.\\nThanks to the system’s versatility, it can operate under\\ndifferent patient conditions and problems, presenting\\nhigh robustness and reliability.\\n• Financial Market Analysis and Algorithmic Trad-\\ning: In the finance industry [48], [49], an agentic AI\\nsystem was used for trading strategies and real-time\\nmarket optimization with minimum human interaction.\\nTo minimize strategies, the AI adjusts them based on past\\nand current data to improve trading outcomes in times\\nof great market volatility. This case study showcases the\\nefficacy and flexibility of agentic AI in fast-paced and\\nhigh-risk settings as minor enhancements in speed and\\naccuracy in decision-making lead to significant financial\\nreturns.\\n• Autonomous Customer Support in E-Commerce: On\\nan e-commerce platform, a customer service e-agent\\nmade possible by Agentic AI technology begs unas-\\nsisted attention [50], knowing full well the needs of\\nthe individual user owing to their past behavior and\\nknown preferences. Over time, the AI agent adapts to\\npast interactions and input to the system to improve\\nits responses to questions; this is a classic illustration\\nof a good human-AI relationship [51]. Customers have\\ngenerally been more satisfied with the individualized\\nand context-responsive adaptive support, and the case\\ndemonstrates the merits of incorporating Agentic AI in\\ncustomer-facing initiatives.\\n• Smart Manufacturing and Predictive Maintenance:\\nOn a plant floor, agentic AI computes the predicted time\\nto failure of the machine and the remaining useful life\\nand when to perform maintenance [52] activities so as to\\nmaximize operational availability. This system leverages\\ndata from a cluster of machines to proactively predict\\nfuture failures and optimize the distribution of resources,\\nwhich, in turn, drives the production process. From\\nexample deployments, the robustness and scalability of\\nthe Agentic AI system have shown its ability to function\\nefficiently in large-scale and data-driven operations.\\nThese case studies emphasize the applicability of Agentic\\nAI technologies in various industries, from healthcare to\\nfinancial and manufacturing. They all demonstrate various\\naspects of these technologies in practical use that can be\\nscalable for different levels of complexity issues.\\nC. BENCHMARKING\\nBenchmarking is one of the most important procedures for\\nassessing Agentic AI performance and its standard model.\\nThis step is important as it allows model researchers and de-\\nvelopers to model. Some several standardized benchmarking\\ndatasets and environments have been developed and are now\\nused to carry out Agentic AI:\\n• Healthcare Datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, PhysioNet):\\nHealth care datasets [53], [54] are applied in the train-\\ning and evaluating systems for AI designs for patient\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\n11\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

There is a straightforward design problem here because\\npeople’s goals do not always lead to intended outcomes, which\\ncould, for example, call for developing inappropriate goals,\\ntechniques, or strategies.\\nHowever, the question of goal misalignment is sometimes\\nmore easily addressed than when the central goals of the\\nprojects are multi-dimensional and contingent on the project\\ncontext. For example, in the case of medical ethics, an AI\\nagent operating for a maximum recovery rate of the patients\\nmight be focusing on those strategies that work fast and\\ngive results even in the short term but may not be the\\nbest thing in the long term. Furthermore, these issues are\\nintertwined with ethical goals and values structures, which\\nare difficult to articulate and integrate within the goal system\\ndue to cross-cultural or industry particularities. Addressing\\nthis problem is a requirement because other researchers are\\ninvestigating aligned frameworks like value alignment and\\ninverse reinforcement learning, wherein the etic systems are\\ncongruent with the emic reward systems. However, these\\nexplanations are still at the very basic understanding and need\\na lot of work to cope with complex changes in human goals.\\nB. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SITUATIONAL ADAPTABILITY\\nAs mentioned earlier, agentic AIs tend to be used in dynamic\\nand highly complex environments. This adaptability challenge\\nrelates to adapting to real-world conditions, which may change\\nwithin a narrow time frame without human intervention. In\\npractical terms, it is quite challenging to be highly adaptive,\\nas many dynamics in the real world are highly unpredictable\\nsuch as market trends in financial investment, epidemiological\\ntrends in health care, or even journey events in autonomous\\ncars.\\nFor most agentic AI systems, technological or contextual\\nbarriers require action even when there is incomplete infor-\\nmation, increasing performance reliability ambiguities. For\\ninstance, in the case of autonomous driving, the agentic AI\\nmay not be familiar with the surrounding traffic conditions or\\nweather patterns such as snow or heavy rainfall, necessitating\\nthe need to adapt in a safe manner to maintain efficiency.\\nWhile meta-learning and reinforcement learning can help\\nincrease the adaptability of agents by allowing them to learn\\nfrom their past, the limitations lie within the approaches\\nas well, as adaptation and robustness are difficult goals\\nto achieve. Furthermore, implementing machine learning\\nmodels based on generalized processes in such complex\\nenvironments usually requires a high computing time, which\\nis only sometimes practical.\\nC. RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS\\nAgentic AIs are complex systems that require lots of compu-\\ntation and energy resources for their training and deployment\\nphases in navigable spaces. One is reinforcement learning,\\nwhich greatly relies on simulation and data processing and\\nconsequently increases the cost and time of training when used.\\nMilling out time for resource demands in real-time decision-\\nmaking circumstances is a big challenge in applications such\\nas the finance industry and autonomous vehicles.\\nIn addition, hardware is another resource for Agentic AI,\\nas these systems usually require specialized facilities when\\ndeployed in real-world environments. For instance, if an\\nautonomous drone or robot is to be used, it would require high-\\nperforming GPUs, low-latency sensors, and a vital energy\\nsource to enable prompt decision-making. In addition, the\\nproliferation of agentic systems, especially those based on\\ncentralized control and monitoring, can put an increasing\\nstrain on data storage, processing and network bandwidth\\nresources. Coupled with these challenges are the hardware\\noptimization methods and energy-efficient algorithms that\\nwill be required to implement Agentic AI systems largely and\\ncost-effectively efficiently.\\nD. SCALABILITY\\nWith the complexity of design increasing, scaling improves\\nthe system’s performance. Some applications of Agent AI,\\nwhether in smart cities, healthcare, or financial services,\\nare massive in scale, requiring a higher AI-to-agent ratio,\\nmultifaceted tasks, or huge amounts of data to be handled.\\nHowever, it is nontrivial to ensure that such systems can\\nbe scaled up to a higher level without losing some key\\nperformance metrics, as it usually involves a multitude of\\nconcurrent tasks and data sources.\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\n13\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

For example,\\nin a smart city, there may be an AI that manages traffic,\\nenergy, and waste collection. Different architectures must\\nbe capable of getting required subsystems to work together\\nand perform complex tasks simultaneously. Besides, as most\\narchitects understand, the scaling of Agent AI also magnifies\\nproblems like goal dependency, resource usage, and the ability\\nto act in plenty of scenarios. Today, decentralized control,\\nfederated learning, and hierarchical structures are being used\\nor researched to improve scalability. However, the problem\\nremains as scaling out seamless techniques is a technological\\nlimitation related to AI operating at a larger scale.\\nTable 10 provides a summary of the primary technical\\nchallenges and limitations faced in the development and\\ndeployment of Agentic AI. Addressing these challenges is\\nessential to advancing the field and ensuring that Agentic AI\\nsystems can function effectively and responsibly in real-world\\nscenarios.\\nVIII. ETHICAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\\nIMPLICATIONS\\nA. ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY\\nIn light of the decision-making independence such systems\\ndisplay, understanding accountability and responsibility in\\nAgentic AI systems is a complex challenge. With the more\\ntraditional AI systems, tools fall under the purview of people\\n– the developer, the operator, or the user and the responsibility\\nrests with the person who uses the tool. With Agentic AI,\\nthe question of accountability is more contentious due to\\nthe nature of an independent-acting AI. In situations where\\nautonomous AI makes a decision that results in a negative\\noutcome, the question of responsibility is often misplaced; is\\nit the developer, the service provider who deploys the AI, or\\nthe AI system.\\nThis particular issue comes out clearly in areas such as\\nfinance and healthcare, where such systems deal with high-\\nstakes decision-making with high repercussions. There needs\\nto be a more significant gap between the responsibility and\\nliability attribution frameworks and the behavioral intricacies\\npresent in Agentic AI systems. Therefore, Regulations and\\npossibly new legal structures must be invoked to delineate\\nresponsibility or accountability, especially in environments\\nwhere multiple stakeholders are participating in the execution\\nof the system, which is most of the time.\\nB. BIAS, FAIRNESS, AND TRANSPARENCY\\nIt is also known that agentic AI systems may replicate and\\nexacerbate biases in the training data available to them. The\\nnotion of bias is especially concerning regarding the use of\\nAgentic AI in hiring, policing, and lending practices. Not\\nonly must these biases be acknowledged, but they must also\\nbe addressed through appropriate data management, careful\\nalgorithm deployment, and active bias reduction programs.\\nStill, it is essential to note that addressing bias and mitigating\\nit in autonomous systems is a much more difficult task than\\nin traditional AI because of the nature of the tasking such\\nsystems are designed to perform.\\nAnother important aspect that also helps enhance fair-\\nness and trust in Agentic AI [60] systems is transparency.\\nThese systems’ operations must be explained through XAI\\napproaches, and there must be an effort to make transpar-\\nent decision-making processes for end users and relevant\\nstakeholders. This exposure can help effectively check an\\nAI’s actions and create a framework for tackling bias or\\ninjustice. However, explainability is quite challenging to attain\\nfundamentally, and a more significant deal of it is supposed\\nto be achieved in cases of agentic AI systems, which tend to\\nuse deep reinforcement learning models. This area of concern\\nhas always been finding the right balance between structural\\ncomplexity and transparency.\\nC. PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES\\nThe agents can perform their functions effectively in different\\nenvironments by relying on relevant information, often private\\nin domains like healthcare and finance, that are already\\nsensitive areas. Such reliance on personal information invites\\nprivacy concerns as data can be mishandled and even accessed\\nillegally, leading to a large breach of user privacy. Additionally,\\nin this context, the autonomous ability of the Agentic AI can\\npose a challenge as the data usage can be difficult to track,\\nthus increasing the likelihood of privacy abuse.\\nThere is also a security challenge in that cyber-attacks can\\nthreaten these systems, undermining their intended purpose\\nand exposing weaknesses in the system in place. If agentic AI\\nsystems are hacked, they could bring forth a lot of destruction,\\nprimarily when the systems govern critical infrastructure or\\nsensitive tasks that need to be decided within that context.\\nThere is a great need to maintain a robust and holistic approach\\ntowards cybersecurity, as it is required to secure the infor-\\nmation that such systems depend on and their functionality.\\nWhile techniques such as differential privacy and secure multi-\\nparty computation may seem promising, privacy and security\\nthreats still exist, so implementation should be done carefully\\nto retain the required functional privacy.\\nD. REGULATORY AND LEGAL PERSPECTIVES\\nThe regulatory and legal perspective on Agentic AI is still a\\nwork in progress as regulators try to streamline the unique\\nchallenges that autonomous systems present. The AI regula-\\ntions as they stand today mainly address privacy, transparency,\\nand accountability issues but may not necessarily tackle the\\nchallenges posed by Agentic AI’s autonomy.

Legal standards for Agentic AI are\\nlikely to include risk management plans that contain require-\\nments for conducting risk assessments, periodic audits, and\\ncertifications for systems operating in susceptible sectors such\\nas health, finance, and security. It is, however, expected that\\nas Agentic AI progresses, developing legal frameworks that\\nenable innovation while enhancing safety and accountability\\nwill be crucial.\\nTable 11 summarizes the primary ethical and governance\\nconsiderations for Agentic AI, highlighting the complexities\\nthat arise as these systems become increasingly autonomous.\\nIX. CURRENT FRAMEWORKS FOR SAFE AND\\nACCOUNTABLE AGENTIC AI\\nA. SAFETY PROTOCOLS\\nSeveral safety measures and frameworks have been created as\\na requirement to prevent the autonomous risks involved with\\ndecision-making. One of the most basic methods is goal safety\\nprotocols, being objective-oriented procedures to suggest to\\nthe AI which goals are acceptable to pursue and which actions\\nare harmful. These protocols prevent harm by ensuring that\\nAI endeavors to achieve legal, safe, and ethical goals. Also, to\\nprevent AI from going out of bounds or reaching unanticipated\\ndangerous situations, fail-safe mechanisms [63] are deployed,\\nwhich can adjust or even terminate AI activities altogether.\\nOne such framework primarily employed is the risk\\nevaluation and management protocol [64], which leads\\nto the review of the risks posed by the actions of the AI,\\nand subsequently, the control measures are put in place.\\nThis is especially important in healthcare and autonomous\\ndriving scenarios, where AI takes actions that impact human\\nlives. Additionally, some Agentic AI systems utilize ethical\\nguardrails [65] , which restrain the AI from making decisions\\nthat raise ethical concerns and promote the AI to perform\\naccording to social norms and ethics. The illustrated safety\\nprotocols work as a system of layers, offering a good level of\\nprotection for the abuse of Agentic AI in an ethical manner.\\nB. MONITORING AND CONTROL MECHANISMS\\nThe autonomous action of agentic AI systems requires mon-\\nitoring and control mechanisms to govern such actions and\\nallow for human intervention where necessary. Real-time\\nmonitoring systems [66], [67] oversee the AI’s activities\\nand decisions and allow humans to intervene if necessary.\\nFor example, in the case of financial trading systems, AI can\\nbe employed to identify unusual trade patterns in real-time\\ntrading by alerting the relevant authorities and allowing for\\nthe conduct of such activities to be at acceptable risk levels.\\nSuch frameworks as Human-in-the-loop (HITL) [68] and\\nhuman-on-the-loop (HOTL) [69] have been designed with\\nthe idea of maintaining an equilibrium between the extent of\\nautonomy experienced and the necessity of human control.\\nWhen HITL configurations are deployed, human operators\\ntend to approve some actions and directly interact with the\\nAI while making certain decisions. On the other hand, in\\nHOTL systems, the human supervisor monitors the AI without\\ndeciding on every action but can intervene when necessary.\\nThese mechanisms are essential for healthcare and other\\nserious decisions involving AI, where the presence of human\\nintelligence is still required.\\nOverride protocols also exist in Agentic AI systems to\\nstop or change actions undertaken by the AI if a situation is\\nclassified as unforeseen or falls outside the reasonable range\\nof expected behavior. Last-line systems provide another level\\nof defense by making it possible for the AI to be overpowered\\nby a human if its autonomous conduct becomes damaging.\\nCombined with the aforementioned, these monitoring and\\ncontrol measures are designed to deliver a multitude of defense\\nin depth to ensure that the agentic artificial intelligence does\\nnot exceed controlled and supervised settings, with all sorts\\nof human intervention procedures firmly in place.\\nC. TRANSPARENCY MECHANISMS\\nTrust and accountability are foundational to the deployment\\nof Agentic AI, and both can be eroded owing to lack of\\ntransparency. Explainable AI (XAI) [70], [71] techniques have\\nbeen proposed to offer a more transparent view of the inner\\nworkings of these multi-layered decision-making AI models.\\nAs a result, XAI enriches the accountability of the processes\\ninvolved in reaching decisions as leaders in a particular field,\\nsuch as that of finance and healthcare, where decisions have\\nprofound consequences, are informed about the premises on\\nwhich specific actions were taken.\\nBeyond just the transparent nature, audit trails can also be\\nadded as an extra layer within Agentic AI systems to document\\nevery logic and decision so that the actions taken by the AI can\\nbe examined afterward. These logs are perfect for compliance\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\n15\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

The company also\\nemploys Model Cards, which contain information on\\na model’s performance, limitations, and intended appli-\\ncation, allowing users to appreciate the strengths and\\nweaknesses of AI systems.\\n• OpenAI’s Charter and Safety Standards: OpenAI\\nundertook to adopt a charter that contains ethical and\\nsafety standards to be observed in developing general-\\npurpose AI.

This\\norganization’s safety research is directed at developing\\nmodels meant to interact and operate in unpredictable\\nenvironments, allowing for the responsible future of\\nAgentic AI.\\n• The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous\\nand Intelligent Systems: IEEE’s initiative has for-\\nmulated standards [74] with corresponding guidelines\\non ethical AI and addressed areas such as matters of\\ntransparency, accountability, as well as data integrity.\\nThey are aimed at assisting developers in setting the\\nstandard for the UK AI systems that they develop so that\\nthese systems will not only work but must be ethical\\nand social, ensuring trust and safety in autonomous AI\\ntechnologies.\\nThese case studies illustrate diverse governance approaches\\nthat balance innovation with safety, accountability, and trans-\\nparency. Table 12 summarizes these frameworks, comparing\\nkey principles and focus areas.\\nX. OPEN RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND FUTURE\\nDIRECTIONS\\nThe development and deployment of Agentic AI systems\\npresent several open research challenges that require attention\\nto ensure safe, effective, and ethically aligned AI. This\\nsection explores these challenges and outlines potential future\\ndirections for advancing Agentic AI.\\nA. ENHANCED ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE\\nIn dynamic and uncertain contexts, Agentic AI systems must\\ndemonstrate adaptability and resilience as they operate in the\\nenvironment. Most existing models do not generalize across\\nthe environments or change significantly without retraining.\\nThus, future work might involve solving meta-learning and\\ntransfer-learning problems specifically for Agentic AI systems,\\nallowing them to rapidly adapt to new situations based on their\\nprevious experiences.

IMPROVING GOAL ALIGNMENT WITH HUMAN\\nVALUES\\nIntegrating ethical and value-based human approaches into\\nAgentic AI systems is one of the open branches of research\\nthat should be advanced in the future. Given the autonomous\\nnature of operating these systems, there exists the possibility\\nof a goal misalignment problem whereby the AI is driven\\nto do the right thing.

INTEGRATION INTO LIVING SOFTWARE AND\\nCYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS\\nWhen Agentic AI is widespread, developing robust ethical\\nand global guidelines for this technology application and\\ndevelopment will be essential. Autonomous decision-making\\nin the systems complicates ethical issues like bias, privacy,\\naccountability, and transparency. Areas of future research can\\nbe directed at how to build a universal ethical framework\\nfor Agentic AI, which may include mechanisms of multi-\\ndimensional ethical audit, oversight, and certification. This\\nincludes initiatives involving policymakers, ethicists, and AI\\npractitioners to embed supervisory mechanisms that foster\\nadvancements without undermining other societal interests\\n[75].\\nD. ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS AND GLOBAL STANDARDS\\nThe definition of AI agency is still in the making stage, and\\nhow advanced decision-making, planning, and reasoning [76]\\nwill be embraced within Agentic AI is still being determined.\\nTheoretical advances in multi-agent systems such as coordi-\\nnation, decentralized decision-making, or structured ’goal’\\nmanagement could help increase the autonomy of AI systems\\nwithout losing control. Also, a better understanding of agents’\\ncognitive functions, such as curiosity, intrinsic motivation, and\\nmoral reasoning, could contribute to developing more robust\\nand responsible Agentic AI systems. Formulating scripts for\\nAI agencies will be vital for ensuring that these systems can\\noperate in a deterministic and dependable manner in diverse\\nand complex environments [77].\\nE. THEORETICAL ADVANCES IN AI AGENCY\\nThe concept of agency in AI is still evolving, and there\\nis much to be explored regarding how Agentic AI can\\ndevelop advanced decision-making, planning, and reasoning\\nabilities. Theoretical research into topics such as multi-agent\\ncoordination, decentralized decision-making, and long-term\\ngoal management could provide new insights into enhancing\\nAI autonomy while maintaining control [78]. Additionally,\\nadvancing our understanding of cognitive functions like\\ncuriosity, intrinsic motivation, and moral reasoning in artificial\\nagents could help design more robust and ethically aligned\\nAgentic AI systems. Developing formal models of AI agency\\nwill be essential for ensuring these systems can act responsibly\\nand predictably in diverse and complex environments.\\nTable 13 provides a summary of the primary open research\\nchallenges and future directions in Agentic AI. Each area\\nhighlights critical aspects of advancing the field responsibly\\nand sustainably.\\nF. SCALABILITY AND EFFICIENCY\\nThe deployment of Agentic AI systems in large-scale and\\ncomplex environments imposes new constraints, resulting\\nin vast requirements for scalability and efficiency. There\\nare scenarios when such systems need to manage resources\\nand information at large, interact with numerous agents, and\\nmake decisions within a short period. For both scalability and\\nefficiency to be achieved, new advancements in algorithms,\\narchitectures, and hardware have to be made. This research\\narea is characterized by the use of centerless and hierarchical\\nframeworks and distributed processing or energy-efficient\\nhardware.\\nAside from its numerous advantages, a well-known lim-\\nitation that stems from the emergence of decentralized\\narchitectures is their integration into large-scale systems.\\nSince the control process can be handled by numerous nodes\\nin a fully distributed way, there is no need for a single\\ncentralized controller. Thus, the responsibility and load of this\\nnode do not affect the system’s scalability. An improvement\\nof specific processes in this-style architecture might include\\ncertain structural, behavioral rules that regularize agents’\\nactions regarding network interactions. The more structures\\ndecorated with efficient elements of decentralized control,\\nthe quicker the optimized directional tasks and networks as\\na whole system will be, where optimization processes occur\\nin bulks of intelligent agents. As it has become apparent in\\nrecent years, these tasks have become possible with systems\\nbased on swarm intelligence and decentralized [79] control of\\nstructures and processes.\\nAnother area of interest is the hierarchical models, which\\nbreak down decision-making processes into different layers\\n[80], where the system can only focus on general goals\\nand distribute particular actions to subordinate agents. For\\ninstance, in the smart city context, a hierarchical Agentic AI\\ncould oversee the movement of cars throughout the city.

This configuration diminishes the computation\\neach agent has to perform and enables better system scalability.\\nThe hierarchical models have found much application in the\\ncoordinated control of multiple, interdependent processes in\\na system since they allow for agnostic task scheduling as the\\nstate of the system changes.\\nBalanced loading of tasks among processors is another\\nfactor that improves scalability since it allows distribut-\\ning computations over several devices or servers. Within\\ndistributed processing frameworks, large scale Agentic AI\\nsystems could make the most of cloud or edge computing\\nresources to carry out computation in multiple processes and\\nlower the time taken to respond. Such a situation proves\\nhelpful in operating in remote applications or in time-critical\\nsituations such as autonomous vehicles or smart grid systems\\nwhere real-time data processing and decision-making are crit-\\nical. There is ongoing advancement in deploying distributed\\nAI frameworks, such as federated learning [81] and edge AI\\n[82], that enhance the maneuverability of Agentic AI systems\\nin a wider operational area with dispersed installations [83].\\nApart from the AI systems integration, improvement of the\\nAgentic AI systems embodies energy-efficient algorithms\\nand hardware optimizations [84]. This is vital when the ap-\\nplications must run endlessly and provide real-time responses.\\nSeveral Agentic AI models are built using operationally\\nexpensive algorithms like deep reinforcement learning, re-\\nquiring enormous power resources. Further progress is made\\nin energy-efficient machine learning approaches, such as\\nsparse neural networks and quantized models that address\\nthe computation requirements at lower levels while retaining\\nthe quality of the end products. Furthermore, neuromorphic\\nprocessors and AI accelerators are some of the emerging\\nhardware technologies that are meant to enable the perfor-\\nmance of AI tasks with minimal power requirements. These\\nhardware improvements are critical in expanding the Agentic\\nAI systems to edge devices and IoT applications with limited\\nor no power resources.\\nAlthough progress has been achieved, they only partially\\nsolve the problem of scalability and efficiency, which continue\\nto be active research issues as real-world environments\\nbecome increasingly complex. Future directions in this area\\ninclude the development of adaptive resource allocation\\ntechniques [85] that dynamically allocate computational\\nresources based on task importance, as well as self-optimizing\\nalgorithms [86] that adjust their complexity dynamically\\ndepending on the requirements. Moreover, thanks to collab-\\norative intelligence [87] conception, agents will be able to\\nsolve issues without complicated integration processes as they\\nwill be able to handle sophisticated operations collectively,\\nthus enhancing system scalability.\\nG. ENHANCED ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE\\nAgentic AI systems, particularly those employed by a human\\nworker or soldier, are built to endure persistence under\\ndemanding, unpredictable conditions. Therefore, achieving\\npersistent operational success would require these systems to\\nmodify their actions autonomously and gain further learning\\nresilience constantly. How can one reach such a high level\\nof learning resilience? One possible answer lies in the use of\\nAgentic AI technologies that can generalize across different\\nenvironments and concepts, deal with high uncertainty, and\\ncope with unforeseen interruptions.\\nOne exciting way of achieving such resilience is through\\nmeta-learning, or what children call “learning to learn.” Such\\nmeta-learning algorithms enable an AI to learn information\\nthat may apply to different assignments or environments,\\nallowing the AI to be flexible with virtually no retraining.\\nFor example, in robotic tasks [88], a meta-learning agent\\nraised in one environment (let’s say, in the house) can move\\nto an alternative environment (the outside) and assume the\\nknowledge of moving within the outside environment. This is\\nbecause AI can now learn like humans [89] and use its past\\nexperiences in the environment to approach new situations\\n[90].\\nAnother significant approach for enhancing adaptability is\\ncalled transfer learning [91]. It has proved that unlike static\\nmodels trained for a particular purpose, a learning model\\ntrained for one task can perform a similar or even related,\\nyet distinct, task. This method is particularly convenient for\\nAgentic AIs acting in many different operational spheres,\\nenabling the system to leverage its previous lessons instead of\\n18\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Transfer learning is known to be effective\\nduring these scenarios since it allows the AI to adjust to\\ndifferent patient profiles or drive in different environments,\\nsuch as autonomous driving.\\nResilience in the case of Agentic AI systems is crucial\\nas it allows them to deliver consistent outcomes despite\\nupsets being caused by compromised sensors, intermittent\\nnetworks or external factors that were not anticipated. To\\nincrease resilience, there are ongoing investigations on robust\\nreinforcement learning techniques that enable the reliable\\nfunctioning of agents in the presence of consistent uncertainty\\nor unknown noise. Robust reinforcement learning methods\\nrely on dual dynamics, allowing the learner to seek perfor-\\nmance maximization and impact minimization of stochastic\\nevents. This dual objective ensures the agent can effectively\\nimplement its functionalities even when the normal conditions\\nvary.\\nSelf-recovery mechanisms are being explored as supple-\\nmentary to everyday learning strategies. Self-recovery mecha-\\nnisms allow Agentic AI systems to auto-flag and rectify their\\nduplicates without help. For example, self-recovery strategies\\nin autonomous robotics may include obstacle avoidance\\nstrategies where the robot uses an alternative approach or site\\nconfiguration strategies. System self-recovery mechanisms\\nallow seamless system restoration after a range of disruptions,\\nwhich is particularly beneficial to mission-critical areas like\\ndisaster management and space exploration, where human\\nintervention is not always feasible.\\nThe stand-out areas of research that are helpful in both\\nthe modification and robustness of Agentic AI include real-\\ntime learning. AI self-recovery mechanisms [92], on the other\\nhand, include real-time learning. This mechanism allows\\nAI systems to receive and integrate new information into\\nrelevant models without ceasing operational activities. This is\\nexcellent, for example, in the finance or cyber warfare zones\\nmodels, which require swift AI alterations on market changes\\nor threats. However, with this capability, new challenges also\\narise related to the real-time processing of data, the ability to\\nconduct computation, model maintenance, and stability, and\\nthese need to be addressed in future studies.\\nLooking to the future, progress in improving adaptability\\nand survivability will likely include the creation of context-\\naware learning algorithms [93], which evaluate the setting\\nand act by it. In other words, some form of contextual AI\\ncould switch its unitary decision-making style depending on\\nuncertainty or resource availability. Furthermore, investigation\\nof multi-modal learning [94], [95], which fuses information\\nfrom multiple sources and types to better understand different\\nsituations, may assist in improving the versatility of Agentic\\nAI systems in the operative context. With visual, auditory,\\nand other kinds of information, multi-modal learning can\\nbe particularly effective for autonomous vehicles trying to\\nfunction in complex situations.\\nH. ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS AND GLOBAL STANDARDS\\nThe increasing capabilities of Autonomous Agentic AI sys-\\ntems operating in significant sectors have intensified the call\\nfor appropriate ethical considerations and global standards to\\nbe put in place. These considerations and standards are pivotal\\nin regulating how Agentic AI interacts with stakeholders and\\nthe environment to minimize adverse impacts, biases, and\\nthreats to safety and privacy. In addition, appropriate and well-\\nthought-out ethical considerations and global standards also\\nseek to define the scope and areas of transparency, equity,\\naccountability, and user privacy, which need to be emphasized\\nin the design and use of AI.\\nOne of the critical barriers to establishing these frameworks\\nis the existence of ethical and legal variety in different\\nsocieties. Ethical issues, including data protection, trans-\\nparency in who took the decision, and reliance on autonomous\\ndecisions, may range from one society to another depending\\non legal order, customs, traditions, or politics. For these\\ndifferences to be addressed while promoting synergies among\\nregions, a global set of ethical standards for AI governance\\nis fundamental. Establishing universal ethical principles can\\nprovide the basis for this alignment by developing common\\napproaches to equity, non-maleficence and beneficence that\\nwould override local differences.\\nTransparency and Explainability are undoubtedly the\\ncomponents of an ethical algorithm since they allow third\\nparties to comprehend the decision-making process of artifi-\\ncial intelligence. In Agentic AI, such attributes are necessary\\nfor users’ trust, especially in crucial sectors like healthcare\\nand finance, where the rationale behind the decision needs\\nto be accountable. These include XAI techniques that allow\\nstakeholders to explain the interpretation process. Therefore,\\ngiven the erosion of these fundamental rights, these frame-\\nworks should emphasize the need to incorporate stakeholders’\\nresponsibilities and authorities’ mechanisms to scrutinize AI-\\ngenerated decisions [96].\\nMore important and unwaveringly related to the devel-\\nopment of ethical frameworks is the issue of an Account-\\nability and Responsibility. With the growing autonomy of\\nagents in society, there have been significant difficulties in\\ndetermining who should be held responsible for the results\\nof AI-enhanced acts. Provisions for processes that would\\nenable tracing responsibility in a wide range of stakeholders,\\nincluding farmers, custodians, and machines, must be in place.\\nSome approaches suggest an AI responsibility chain, which\\nseparates the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder\\nduring the development and deployment process to prevent\\nover-reliance on one individual [97].\\nPrivacy and Security Standards are especially critical\\nwhen addressing Agentic AI, which generally requires operat-\\ning on susceptible data. There should be guidelines prescribing\\nhow data is managed, secured or anonymized to meet user\\nprivacy. This includes baseline restrictions on processing,\\nsuch as the use of differential privacy and secure access to\\ndatabases, which allow for reducing possibilities for breaches\\nor abuse of the data.

In particular, some of the core material for the\\nlegal issues of privacy and other user rights are contained in\\nthe Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by the\\nEuropean Union and the General Data Protection Regulation.\\nSimilarly, the IEEE and the Partnership on AI organizations\\nhave also formulated some behavioral artificial intelligence\\nethics addressing responsibility, fairness, and openness issues.\\nAlthough these guidelines have no universal application, effec-\\ntive international government authority has been advocated to\\ncoordinate the interaction between AI policies and standards\\nfrom different countries.\\nA further development concerning the issue is establishing\\nan internationally operating AI coordinating entity or a\\nconsortium like in Europe that could promote the estab-\\nlishment of AI standards and global adherence to ethical\\nprinciples. This organization would create an objective to\\nstandardize AI regulations so that ethical norms and safety\\nrequirements will invariably be provided across countries and\\nindustries. Moreover, it necessitates research on adaptive\\nregulatory regimes [98] that are responsive to technological\\ndevelopments.\\nTable 14 summarizes the primary components of ethical\\nframeworks and global standards for Agentic AI, outlining\\nessential areas for responsible and safe AI governance.\\nI. THEORETICAL ADVANCES IN AI AGENCY\\nAI systems with the potential for intelligent action still need\\ntheoretical development regarding number and complexity in\\nunderstanding agency, self-organization, and decision-making\\nprocesses. For now, embodiments of Agentic AI exhibit their\\nexpected performance in structured tasks and environments,\\nyet transferring such capabilities into higher-order, poly-\\ncontext environments will necessitate a sensible underlying\\nframework. In a larger perspective, however, some theoretical\\nextensions of the issues, like multi-agent coordination, meta-\\ngoal achievement, active persistence, and planner controlling\\nwith ethical consideration, assist the AI models in behaving\\nappropriately in different environments.\\nMulti-agent coordination is an example of such a class of\\ntheories, and it is concerned with allowing AI agents to engage,\\ncommunicate, and collaborate in environments that contain\\nmultiple autonomous entities. In particular, practical appli-\\ncations multi-agent coordination is crucial for applications\\nin collaborative robotics, decentralized systems, and smart\\ncity architecture. This domain examines how agents learn\\nto pursue their separate aims while achieving mutual goals\\nor seeking to work cooperatively, utilizing materials from\\ngame theory, reinforcement learning, and communication\\ntheory. Developments in this domain will allow Agentic AI\\nto carry out interdependent complex tasks where agents must\\ncooperate and compete.\\nLong-term goal management is decisive and is character-\\nized as having advanced agentic capabilities. There are deeply\\ningrained limitations concerning timelines with current AI\\nsystems. Current AIs tend to optimize for shorter timelines,\\nthus losing the capacity to strategize, forecast trends, and dis-\\ntinguish between sub-objectives. Theoretical work addresses\\nthe practical challenges of enabling AIs to set and pursue\\nlong-range goals as conditions change and constraints emerge.\\nHierarchical reinforcement learning and temporal reasoning\\nare two measures that have promise as they allow AI systems\\nto decompose high-level goals into sub-tasks, which take the\\nsystem toward the overall end state through predetermined\\nobjectives.\\nAgents’ ability to wait for a reward and workers’ pursuit on\\ntheir own define two self-rewarding procedures that emerge\\ntowards the creation of agentic AI; both procedures in domina-\\ntion with zero hit or standalone provide enough basis to move\\nforward without external incentives or directives. An emerging\\nfield of research in self-directed strategy relies on developing\\nagents that can explore, learn, and adapt based solely on their\\ncuriosity about their environment. This would be important\\nin cases where the information space is uncertain or where\\nthe goal is not defined and other variables are likely to change\\nwithin the domain of the goal. Further development in the\\ntheory of self-rewarding will enhance AI agents’ abilities\\nto be goal-oriented and directed by a flexible strategy while\\ndealing with complex problems caused by a lack of structure.\\nMoral reasoning and ethical decision-making are gaining\\nacceptance in the field of advanced AI agency [99], partic-\\nularly now that AI is increasingly used for sensitive and\\nhigh-risk tasks. Research on moral reasoning seeks to offer\\na basis for ethical deliberations in autonomous systems so\\nthat Agentic AI can purposefully choose actions with thought\\nof their effects and values. In this context, integrating ethics,\\nphilosophy, and psychology into AI is an overarching aim\\nif ethical AI systems should be created. Codifying moral\\nreasoning in AI will be necessary for health, law and order,\\nand autonomous automobiles, the decision of which can be\\ninfluential to society.\\nA few of the areas of theoretical research that need a\\nmention are self-awareness and meta-cognition [100] in\\nAI which include building systems that understand their\\nactions, abilities, or limitations as self-referential knowledge.\\nAll the AI that are self-aware will be able to self-evaluate\\nwhether they have performed their tasks optimally, what can\\nbe improved, and what actions to take when there are failures\\nor poor performance. Self-agency abilities will also allow AI\\nto assess its strategies and learning processes in the hopes that\\nits agents will be able to enhance their decision-making in\\nthe future. Progress in the self-awareness and meta-cognition\\nareas might allow for the emergence of more sophisticated\\nand flexible Agentic AI systems that enhance and improve\\ntheir performance and robustness in multiple environments.\\nIn this regard, the future possibilities of the works included\\n20\\nVOLUME 4, 2016\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

CONCLUSION\\nA. SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS\\nThis survey has explored the foundational characteristics,\\nmethodologies, applications, challenges, and future directions\\nof Agentic AI. Key findings highlight that Agentic AI rep-\\nresents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence,\\ncharacterized by autonomy, goal-oriented behavior, and adapt-\\nability across diverse environments. We have identified core\\napplications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and\\nmanufacturing, where Agentic AI’s ability to make context-\\naware, autonomous decisions offers transformative benefits.\\nHowever, deploying these systems in real-world scenarios\\nintroduces challenges such as scalability, resource constraints,\\nand ethical concerns, all of which require robust solutions\\nto ensure safe and effective AI deployment. Through a\\ncomparative analysis, we examined various implementation\\nframeworks, tools, and methodologies that contribute to the\\ndevelopment and evaluation of Agentic AI. We also identified\\nopen research challenges, including goal alignment, multi-\\nagent coordination, and regulatory adaptation, which must be\\naddressed to fully realize the potential of Agentic AI.\\nB. FINAL INSIGHTS ON AGENTIC AI\\nAgentic AI holds transformative potential across numerous\\nsectors, promising advances in automation, decision-making,\\nand human-AI collaboration. As these systems evolve, they\\nare poised to tackle complex tasks autonomously, signif-\\nicantly expanding the scope of AI applications in both\\nstructured and unstructured environments. By combining\\nadaptive learning, robust reinforcement mechanisms, and real-\\ntime responsiveness, Agentic AI systems can deliver dynamic\\nsolutions that enhance productivity and efficiency. However,\\nwith increased autonomy comes the responsibility to address\\nethical considerations and ensure accountability, transparency,\\nand fairness. As Agentic AI continues to evolve, it is essential\\nthat these systems are developed with a clear focus on ethical\\nalignment, resilience, and regulatory compliance to prevent\\npotential misuse or unintended consequences.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] A.

The third \\nphase is where agentic AI automates workflows, with or \\nwithout human oversight. The final phase – still a couple of \\nyears away – is the move toward scalable, general-purpose \\nAI across the enterprise.” \\n \\nSusan Emerson, Senior VP, AI Product at Salesforce, says: \\n“Across industries, agentic AI is moving the opportunity \\nbeyond productivity gains to fundamentally reinventing core \\nbusiness processes to deliver measurable impact, \\ntransformed customer experiences, and new operating \\nmodels.”\\nOrganizations don’t \\nexpect high levels of \\nautonomy \\nOver the next 12 months, we expect AI agents with Level 3 \\nautonomy or higher to manage 15% of processes and sub-\\nprocesses in each business function. This will rise to 25% \\nwithin the next one to three years. Fully autonomous AI \\nagents (Level 5) are expected to handle around 4% of \\nbusiness processes within three years. This level of autonomy \\nmay apply to majorly well-scoped processes.

While organizations are not \\nprioritizing full autonomy, AI agents can still deliver significant \\nvalue at intermediate levels of autonomy.

As \\ngen AI and agentic AI adoption accelerates, IT leaders must \\nproactively address ethics and safety concerns, token usage \\nand optimization costs, turning operational oversight into a \\ncompetitive business advantage.”\\nOrganizations must establish or revisit existing ethical AI \\nguidelines.

For example, if an AI agent testing marketing \\ncampaign assets finds that provocative or sensational \\ncontent increases engagement, it flags a dilemma \\nregarding the potential impact on brand credibility and \\nprompts human review. \\n•\\t Make agent decision-making traceable and auditable: \\nEstablish mechanisms to trace the full “thought process” \\nof AI agents, from input to action, to ensure transparency \\nand accountability. This includes detailed action logs, \\nprompts or goals, and embedded reasoning chains that \\ncan be reviewed in audits or challenged in real time. \\n•\\t Create layered governance by design: Prevent failure \\ncascades by designing layered systems where multiple AI \\nagents can critique, supervise, or override each other. \\nIntroduce “guardian agents,” tasked with reviewing high-\\nstakes decisions or stress-testing outputs for bias, \\nhallucinations, or safety risks. This agent-of-agents \\narchitecture mirrors human checks and balances and \\nbuilds resilience into autonomous systems. Dr. Suraj \\nSrinivasan at Harvard Business School says: “While \\ndeploying AI agents, organizations must move beyond \\ntechnical implementation and consider how core values \\nare embedded into these systems. Unlike humans, who \\nnaturally understand context and are guided by \\norganizational ethos, AI agents require these principles to \\nbe explicitly defined and built into their design. Ethics can \\nno longer be managed by exception; they must be \\nembedded into the system from the start.”\\n•\\t Train human workers for ethical fluency: Equip human \\nteams across the organization with the fluency to \\nanticipate ethical and safety challenges posed by AI \\nagents. This includes scenario-based training, decision-\\nmaking frameworks, and cross-functional simulations to \\nstrengthen ethical reflexes, particularly in fast-moving or \\nambiguous situations.\\n•\\t Appoint AI ethicists to embed ethical oversight across \\nthe lifecycle: AI ethicists are responsible for defining and \\nmaintaining a clearly articulated code of ethics for AI \\nagents, aligned with organizational values.
